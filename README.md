### What I learned

Made a multi-page application (SPA). I learned how to send requests to the API, receive a response from the server and process it using the Redux Toolkit, namely using createAsyncThunk, display the received data on the pages. I figured out how routing works using React Router. I better understood how to type components and how to type  data received from the server, how to update data in the store, and use Redux slices. Improved understanding of creating and using services to send requests and receive data. Got a basic understanding of how to work with Tailwind.
